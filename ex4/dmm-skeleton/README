This is a code skeleton for the Assignment #4 of the Parallel Processing Systems
course. The code is fully functional as it is now, meaning you can compile and
run it without a problem. The performance of the GPU kernels are of course
bogus, since they currently do nothing. This is what you should do! :-)

The structure of the repository is as follows:

    dmm-skeleton/
    | -- common/
    | -- cuda/

The code has some `FILLME:' annotations to denote the parts where you
have to fill in some code. Of course, you can do whatever other magic you like,
but use the same timing operations, in order to have a common baseline for
measuring the performance.

Before starting filling up the necessary GPU code, do the following three things
first:

(a) Run `make help' to see what options the Makefile supports.

(b) Run `make all' to compile the project.

(c) Run `./cuda/dmm_main' to get a help message of what the program expects
    from you. Play a bit to get the feeling.

Finally, have a look in the `run_dmm.sh' script before submitting jobs to the
lab's GPU machines.
